### Week 1
A side scrolling, level based platformer, in which you play as a spirit trapped in limbo that can take on different physical attributes (initially a bouncing buoyant ball) in order to navigate through abstract environments in which a single guiding light provides hope of escaping limbo. Along the way you may encounter other spirits also trying to escape, that embody different physical forms and attributes, that you can then acquire and use for yourself by defeating them. 

### Week 2
A side-scrolling, level-based platformer, in which you play as a spirit trapped in limbo that can take on different physical attributes (initially a bouncing buoyant ball) in order to navigate through abstract environments. A single guiding light provides hope of escaping limbo and many are following this same light. It is believed that if a spirit possesses enough light they will be able to enter this guiding light and return to the surface. You must collect masses of light that are rewarded at the end of levels and also able to be found hidden throughout them, some of which can only be found once you have powers acquired later in the game. The amount of light that the player has acquired is used to gate progression through the game, with set amounts of light being necessary to progress at various stages in the game. At times the player may not have all the light necessary to move past these progression gates and need to return to levels to find light that they may have missed. 

 Along the way, you may encounter other spirits also trying to escape, that embody different physical forms and attributes, that you can then acquire and use for yourself by defeating them in boss fights. These will require you to deplete there “spirit gauge” (health bar), by crushing their spirit both literally and metaphorically through challenging encounters that test your reflexes and understand of your different physical forms you can switch between so that you may make contact with their conveniently signposted weak spots/windows.


Light as collectable
	Light as end of stage reward
	Find hidden light sources in stages
	Progression is gated on how much light you have
	Replay levels to acquire hidden light that was originally inaccessible 
	Light is a way of acquiring memories of your living past

5 levels
3 initial levels using first ability
1 boss level
1 level immediately after that uses acquired boss ability


Boss is also a spirit who initially helps you in initially getting through the first levels and acquiring light. It is simply a ploy so that he can try to kill you and acquire the light that you’ve got.
